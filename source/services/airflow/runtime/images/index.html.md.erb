# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We provide container images for the supported runtimes, [Python](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-airflow-python-base) and R (coming soon)

These images include

* Ubuntu base image

* AWS CLI

* NVIDIA GPU drivers

Additionally we create a non-root user (`analyticalplatform`), and a working directory (`/opt/analyticalplatform`)
