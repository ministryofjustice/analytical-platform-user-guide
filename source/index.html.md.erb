> This documentation site is a sandbox to test prototypes. You should continue to use [Analytical Platform User Guidance](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) for up to date information.

This is the user guide for the [Analytical Platform (AP)](https://controlpanel.services.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/). The content only includes tools and services the AP team is responsible for maintaining, or those necessary for using the AP.

You can find information here about how to use the AP, including how to:

- get started with the AP
- use the AP's tools for your work
- troubleshoot problems and get support
- find training for AP tools

This site does not contain:

- MOJ-wide policies or standards
- general information not specific to the AP (for example, how to using GitHub)
- training on coding or AP tools
