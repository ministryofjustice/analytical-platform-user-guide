# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We provide repository templates for the supported runtimes, [Python](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-airflow-python-template) and R (coming soon)

These templates include

* Github Actions workflow to build and scan your container for vulnerabilites with Trivy

* Github Actions workflow to build and test your container's structure

* Github Actions workflow to perform a dependency review of your repository, if its public

* GitHub Actions workflow to build and push your container to Analytical Platform's container registry

* Dependabot configuration for updating GitHub Actions, Docker and dependencies such as Pip

The GitHub Actions workflows call shared workflows we maintain [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-airflow-github-actions)

## Vulnerability scanning

The Github Actions workflow to build and scan your container for vulnerabilites with Trivy, will alert on any CVEs marked `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` that have a fix available

This workflow will download a configuration file associated with the release of the runtime container you are using, this configuration file contains CVEs that have been skipped by the Analytical Platform team

## Configuration testing

To ensure your container is running as the right user, we perform a test using Google's [Container Structure Test ](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) package

The source for the test can be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-airflow-github-actions/blob/main/assets/container-structure-test/container-structure-test.yml)
